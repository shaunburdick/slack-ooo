This bot can be told when you are out of the office. It will then listen to conversations and tell users that mention you that you are not around.

**If you want a personal OoO bot that acts as you, check out [shaunburdick/slack-ooo-personal](https://github.com/shaunburdick/slack-ooo-personal)!**

##Usage
To use this bot, you start a conversation with it:

```
