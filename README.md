This bot can be told when you are out of the office. It will then listen to conversations and tell users that mention you that you are not around.

- Users set themselve out of the office by talking to the bot
- When a user that is set out of office is mentioned in a channel the bot is in, it will send a message to that channel that the user if out of the office and display their out of office message
- The bot can be configured to announce out of office users to specific channels on specific times (bot must be in that channel to make the announcement)

## Announcements
The bot can announce which users are out of office on a schedule. To enable this feature, you need to provide the bot with a list of channels to make the announcement and at what times (local to bot).
- **app.announce.channels**: this is an array of channel names to announce to
  - The bot *must* be a member of the channel in order to make the announcements
  - channels names *must* not contain the starting `#`
- **app.announce.times**: this is an array of times each day to make the announcement
  - Each time will be considered as 24-hour time, (ie `13:00` is 1:00 pm)
